  <p>Residing in South East England, Harun Blissett aka Trimer has been heavily involved in the DnB scene for over 15 years now.
    From an early age he began experimenting with production, creating his own sounds and even writing and recording little piano pieces for his school music studies.
    Music has had a massive impact on his life from travelling up to London to buy records, to spending many hours perfecting his own beats.</p>
  <p>Trimer's vibe and passion for the music really comes across through his energetic and <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/WiEudgOzljc">explosive DJ sets</a></strong>. He has played a number of venues including places such as
    <strong><A href=https://www.ministryofsound.com/club />Ministry of Sound London</A></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.fabriclondon.com/">Fabric London</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cableofficial/">Cable
        London</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://letitroll.eu/">Let it Roll Festival Prague</a></strong>.
